# Village Connect ðŸŒ³

The Village Connect app is designed to bridge the gap between villagers and administrative officials. The app features a login system where users are verified by an admin before
activation. The homepage displays announcements about village happenings, posted by
admins. Users can view market prices for crops by selecting locations from dropdown
options. There is an enquiry section where users can ask crop-related questions that
are answered by admins. The suggestions section allows users to report issues they are
facing. Lastly, the emergency section provides contact information for important services
like ambulance, fire, and police stations. Admins have the authority to accept or
reject new users, post announcements, update market prices, answer enquiries, respond
to suggestions, and manage other admins.
